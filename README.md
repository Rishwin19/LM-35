# LM-35
interface LM35 with led blink.
since i was working on an online simulator i faced many issues.
some specific libraries that i wanted to include was not available on some simulator.
and the main issue was the lack of LM 35 temparature sensor on  some of them.
i used an analog sensor which was not giving me an accurate value of temperature in celcius.
but i somehow managed to find a solution. which i believe to be true.
in some simulator it was needed to subtract an addition 50 degree to correct my temperature value. Which i didnt include in the above code.
I still belive  that it would have been an easy task if i had the hardware accesories on reach.
Thanks for reading.
